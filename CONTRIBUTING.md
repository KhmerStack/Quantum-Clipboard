# Contributing to KhmerStack

First off, thank you! 🙌
Whether you are a senior engineer or a first-year student, we appreciate your help.

## 🎓 Note for Students & Juniors
**You are welcome here.**
If you don't know how to do something (like Git, Pull Requests, or Unit Tests), ask in the Issues tab! We prioritize **learning**. We won't reject your code just because it's not perfect—we will help you improve it.

## ⚡ How to Contribute
1.  **Find an Issue:** Look for issues labeled `good first issue` or `help wanted`.
2.  **Fork & Branch:** Create a branch for your feature (e.g., `feat/add-dark-mode`).
3.  **Code & Test:** Write your code. (Please try to keep it clean!).
4.  **Submit PR:** Open a Pull Request. Explain what you did.

## 🎁 Contributor Rewards Policy (Important)
We want to support students, but please understand our limits.

1.  **Voluntary Basis:** All contributions are open-source and voluntary. Contributing does **not** constitute employment.
2.  **Learning Rewards:** Occasionally, we may offer a small financial reward (Bounty) for specific tasks.
    * These are **gifts** to support your studies (e.g., for coffee, internet, or books).
    * They are **not guaranteed** unless explicitly stated on the Issue ticket.
    * They are awarded based on **code quality** and **impact**, at the maintainer's discretion.
3.  **Sponsorship:** In the future, consistent contributors may be recommended for larger sponsorships if our funding allows.

## ✅ Coding Standards
* **Language:** We communicate in English (code/comments) to be globally accessible, but we can clarify things in Khmer in discussions!
* **Style:** Please run the linter before pushing.
* **Respect:** Be kind. Constructive criticism only.

## 🛡️ Code of Conduct
We are a safe space. Harassment, rude behavior, or gatekeeping is not tolerated.
